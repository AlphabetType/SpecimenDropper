# SpecimenDropper

A collection of scripts and tools to quickly create a specimen.

## Drop to InDesign
With dropToInDesign you can automatically create multiple typeface specimens: Drop one or more fonts onto the app. The script builds a specimen file for every font and opens it for you in InDesign.

* Download the standalone Mac-App here: https://github.com/AlphabetType/SpecimenDropper/releases/tag/1.0
* See [this readme file](https://github.com/AlphabetType/SpecimenDropper/blob/master/dropToInDesign/Readme.md) for further instructions

## ProofRunnter
proofRunner creates an HTML page that displays all fonts inside a directory (and itâ€™s subdirectories). This way you can easily spot erroneous fontfiles and collect them in a list to investigate them further.

* See [this readme file](https://github.com/AlphabetType/SpecimenDropper/blob/master/proofRunner/Readme.md) for further instructions
