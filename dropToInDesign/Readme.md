# Drop to InDesign

## What is it about?

With dropToInDesign you can automatically create multiple typeface specimens:
Drop one or more fonts onto the app and the script builds a specimen-file for every font and opens it for you in InDesign.

* The fonts donâ€™t have to be installed (at least if you use InDesign CS5 or later).
* You can edit the InDesign Template for your needs to create your own branded specimens.

## The specimen template

* You the template file inside the app (Right click on the app, Show package contents -> Resources -> template_specimen.idml) as you wish.
* You can add custom placeholder-variables in your template. (See dev notes below)
* You can duplicate the app, rename it and edit every template specimen for certain needs.

## Any ideas?
This is currently the first version. If you have feature request, just drop us a line!

### Dependencies
* Adobe InDesign CS5+
* MacOSX (If you use want to use the standalone version of SpecimenDropper)


## Dev notes
If you want to have more control (like adding placeholder-variables), you should work with uncompiled version. You can run the script via commandline and add one or more fonts as attributes:

'''python dropToInDesign.py user/test/desktop/FiraSans-Bold.otf user/test/desktop/FiraSans-Bold.otf'''

### Placeholder Variables
With variables you can add dynamic content to your template specimens.

There are currently those variables as presets available in your template:

* {{timestamp}} -> Current date and time 
* {{familyname}} -> Name of the font family
* {{style}} -> Name of the font style
* {{filename}} -> Filename of the font
* {{headline}} -> "alphabet-type.com"

You can add custom variables in '''dropToInDesign.py''' inside the placeholders dictionary. See the code-comments for further information.

## Development Dependencies
* fontTools (Get it here: https://github.com/behdad/fonttools/)
